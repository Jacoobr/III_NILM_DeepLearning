# TaiPowerNILM_DeepLearning
Neuralnilmtp is a module for estimating the energy consumed by individual appliances from aggregate consumption data. In this project, we use Taiwan's power data as reference. Unlike REDD or UKDALE, the sample rate of Taiwan's power data is 60/sec or 180/sec.

Now, we are at THE VERY BEGINNING. One of our big challanges is to estimate the consumption of air conditioner from aggregate consumption, because electric behavior of air conditioners(AC) vary with brand, environmental temperature and size.
